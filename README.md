# Ratchet Robotics' 2016 code
Uses the SDK as a git remote.

## I want to work on a thing!
Just clone the repo.

## Everything else:
There are SDK docs for a reason. Plus there are tons of online tutorials.

## There's a new SDK out, and I want the repo updated!
Due to the shitty way that FIRST packages their SDK, it's not very easy.
**Do not attempt to update the SDK without help! It's a *very* complicated process!**
Instead, ask Liam (@ArchimedesPi) to help you.
